# 🌍 Deep Learning Continent

Welcome to **Deep Learning Continent**, my personal repository documenting my journey through the vast landscape of deep learning. This space serves as a growing map of experiments, notebooks, concepts, and projects that I’ve explored — from the basics to advanced topics.

> 🧠 *“The best way to understand deep learning is to build it, break it, and build it better.”*

## 🚀 Why "Deep Learning Continent"?

Because learning deep learning feels like exploring a new continent — every concept is a city, every model is a landmark, and every experiment is an adventure. This repo tracks my exploration across the key regions of deep learning.

## 🧠 Learning Approach

I follow a hands-on approach:

- 🔬 Build intuition through small experiments
- 📓 Use Jupyter Notebooks for step-by-step walkthroughs
- 📊 Visualize model behavior and performance
- 🧪 Recreate classic models from scratch before using libraries
